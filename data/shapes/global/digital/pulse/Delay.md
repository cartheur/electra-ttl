A **delay** element is a digital circuit component that is used to introduce a time delay between an input signal and an output signal. The amount of delay can be controlled by adjusting the delay time of the element.

There are several types of delay elements in real circuits, but one common example is a simple RC circuit. An RC circuit is made up of a resistor and a capacitor connected in series, with the input signal applied across the capacitor. The output signal is taken across the resistor, and it is delayed by an amount of time determined by the values of the resistor and capacitor.

The amount of delay introduced by an RC circuit can be calculated using the formula:

```
τ = R * C
```

where **τ** is the time constant of the circuit, **R** is the resistance of the resistor, and **C** is the capacitance of the capacitor. The time constant represents the amount of time it takes for the output signal to reach approximately 63% of its steady-state value after a step input is applied.
