A 4-bit data multiplexer (MUX) is a digital circuit that allows selection of
one of two 4-bit input data lines and routes it to a 4-bit output. It uses
a control inputs, commonly called "select lines" or "address lines", to
determine which of the input data lines should be selected and passed through
to the output.

When the select input S is at a certain level, one of the 4-bit input data group
is passed through to the 4-bit output line O. For example, if S is 0 the
multiplexer will select input I0 and pass it through to the output O, while if
S is 1, it will select input I1 and pass it through to the output O.

This allows the multiplexer to selectively route data from one of the two input
groups to a common output, depending on the value of the select input. This can
be useful for situations where multiple sources of data need to be routed to a
common destination, such as in a computer's memory or in digital signal processing
systems.
