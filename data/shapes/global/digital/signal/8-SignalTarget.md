A data bus in a circuit simulator can be thought of as a bundle of parallel
electrical signals that are used to transmit data between different components
within a digital circuit. Each signal in the data bus is labeled with a unique
name or identifier, such as "D0" or "Data[7:0]", to indicate its specific
function or role within the circuit.
