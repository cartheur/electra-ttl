The **JKR-FlipFlop** is a simple enhancement of the SR flip-flop where the state J=K=1 is not forbidden. It works just like a SR flip-flop where J is serving as set input and K serving as reset. The only difference is that for the formerly *forbidden* combination **J=K=1** this flip-flop now performs an action: it inverts its state. As the behavior of the JK flip-flop is completely predictable under all conditions, this is the preferred type of flip-flop for most logic circuit designs. But there is still a problem i.e. both the outputs are same when one tests the circuit practically.

In the JKR-FlipFlop, the **reset input (R**) is used to reset the state of the flip-flop to a known value. When the reset input is high (i.e., at logic level 1), it forces the output(s) of the flip-flop to a known state, which is typically a logic low state (i.e., 0).

This is because of the internal toggling on every propagation elapse completion. The main remedy is going for master-slave jk flip-flop,this flip-flop overrides the self(internal) recurring toggling through the pulsed clocking feature incorporated.
