An **Emboss** filter is an image processing technique that *emphasizes the edges and borders of objects* in a video frame by creating a 3D-like effect. The technique works by detecting changes in the brightness of adjacent pixels in the image and creating a highlight or shadow effect along the edges of these changes.

The emboss filter starts by converting the original image to grayscale, then creates a 3D-like effect by analyzing the grayscale values of neighboring pixels and enhancing the edges of the objects in the image by simulating a directional light source. The result is an image or video frame that appears to have depth and texture, as if it has been carved or stamped out of a material.

Emboss filtering is commonly used in video processing pipelines for a variety of applications, such as enhancing the contrast and sharpness of an image, highlighting the details of a surface, or adding an artistic touch to a video. It is important to note, however, that the emboss filter can sometimes produce unrealistic or undesirable results, especially in low-quality or noisy images or videos. Therefore, it is important to test and fine-tune the filter to achieve the desired video output.
