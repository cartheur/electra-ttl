A **HistogramAdjust** is a filter, that adjusts the brightness and contrast of an image by manipulating its histogram. The histogram of an image represents the distribution of pixel intensities, with darker pixels represented on the left and lighter pixels on the right.

In this automatic HistogramAdjust node, the image's histogram is analyzed, and the brightness and contrast are adjusted based on the distribution of pixel intensities. 

The benefit of using the automatic HistogramAdjust node in a video processing pipeline is that it can quickly and easily adjust the brightness and contrast of a video without requiring manual adjustments for each frame. This can save time and improve the consistency of the video's appearance.
