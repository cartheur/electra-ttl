In practice, the **GaussBlur** effect is commonly used in video processing to smooth out noise and reduce the appearance of jagged edges in images or video. It can also be used to create a soft, dreamy effect in videos or to reduce the visibility of small details or imperfections in a shot.

It applies a Gaussian blur to the input video, which results in a smoothing or softening effect. The blur is achieved by convolving the input image with a 2D Gaussian kernel.

The Gaussian kernel is a matrix of values that determines how the blur is applied to the input image. The values in the kernel are calculated based on the Gaussian distribution, which is a mathematical function that describes the probability distribution of a random variable.

The size of the kernel and the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution determine the amount of blur applied to the input image. A larger kernel or a higher standard deviation will result in a greater amount of blur, while a smaller kernel or a lower standard deviation will result in less blur.

To apply the GaussBlur effect, the input image is convolved with the Gaussian kernel using a convolution filter. The convolution filter calculates the weighted average of the neighboring pixels in the input image, with the weights determined by the values in the Gaussian kernel. This weighted average is then assigned to the output pixel, resulting in a blurred image.
