A video filter that *reduces the overall brightness* of an image is a type of video processing filter that works by decreasing the value of each pixel in the video image. This results in a dimmer and darker appearance.

This filter can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as when the original video footage is too bright, or when the video is being used in a dark environment and the brightness needs to be reduced to avoid eye strain or discomfort.

The filter allows to reduce/increment the level of darken with an input control. Connect a slider to this input to fine-tune the level of brightness reduction.

It is important to note that reducing the brightness can also decrease the contrast and detail in the image, particularly in areas of low contrast. Therefore, it is important to use the filter judiciously and adjust the settings to achieve the desired balance between brightness and detail. Some video processing software includes additional features to mitigate the loss of detail and contrast introduced by the brightness reduction filter, such as contrast adjustment and edge protection.
