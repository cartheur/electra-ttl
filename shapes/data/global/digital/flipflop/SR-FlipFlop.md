# SR-FlipFlop



The SR flip-flop can be considered as a
1-bit memory, since it stores the input pulse even after it has passed. 
Flip-flops (or bi-stables) of different types can be made from logic
gates and, as with other combinations of logic gates, the NAND and
NOR gates are the most versatile, the NAND being most widely used. 
This is because, as well as being universal, i.e. it can be made 
to mimic any of the other standard logic functions, it is also 
cheaper to construct. Other, more widely used types of flip-flop 
are the JK, the D type and T type, which are developments of the 
SR flip-flop
