# BCD to 7 Segment Decoder

A BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) to 7-segment decoder is a digital circuit that 
converts a 4-bit BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) input into the corresponding code 
to drive a 7-segment LED display. The BCD input is a 4-bit binary code that 
represents a decimal digit (0-9), while a 7-segment LED display is a type of 
display that can show decimal digits (0-9) and a few characters by illuminating 
different combinations of 7 segments.

The BCD to 7-segment decoder circuit has four BCD input lines and seven output 
lines, one for each segment of the 7-segment display. The decoder uses logic 
gates (such as AND and OR gates) to translate the BCD input into the appropriate 
signals to turn on and off the segments of the 7-segment display.

In short, the BCD to 7-segment decoder is a digital circuit which takes 4 bit 
BCD number and convert it into the corresponding code which can drive a 
7 segment LED display. This way we can display decimal digits on 7 segment LED 
display.
